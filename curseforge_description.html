<p><strong>About ICannt Mod Pack</strong></p>
<p>ICannt Mod Pack, commonly referred to as IMP is an old series of modpacks dating back to Minecraft 1.5.2 on different launchers. IMP has always just been a general "kitchen sink" kind of modpack with a range of tech, magic and decorative mods geared towards a survival experience. Its first release on curseforge is labelled as version 5.0 to reflect the history of the modpack series. Tyrion Lanister aka the imp from GoT is our mascot (geddit), so the current launcher background has a "right actor, wrong production" thing going ;) SPACEPANTS!</p>

<p><strong>About ICannt and the Official Server</strong></p>
<p>ICannt is a fairly old and mostly dormant gaming community but some of us still hang around on our official Discord. The official server is self funded by me (trab). If you decide to join the server please ask in game to be promoted to miner rank if you want to participate. If you want to host a server, let me know and I will make a server pack available if you need it (you can just strip out the client mods if you know what you are doing).</p>
